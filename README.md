## Brief Overview

This project aims to analyze the dataset obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information about SARS-CoV-2 circulation and co-infection with *Plasmodium falciparum* in Equatorial Guinea. The primary goal of this report was with the 43 genome sequences to explore how prevalent SARS-CoV-2 is in Equatorial Guinea in different identity groups such as sex or age and if any identity group was more susceptible to infection in an area where healthcare may not be the most accessible and other illnesses such as malaria are long-standing issues. 

## SRA Bioproject Details

SRA Bioproject name: Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection with *Plasmodium falciparum* in Equatorial Guinea  
SRA Bioproject ID number: 1034401  
Accession: PRJEB65711

## Brief outline of analysis steps
1. Do exploratory data analysis to fully understand what the dataset contains
2. Explore to see if there is any correlation between the various variables in the dataset  
  2.1. See if there's any relation with SARS-CoV-2 and *Plasmodium falciparum* infection with each   other
3. Draw conclusions with supplement from studies where the data was used
